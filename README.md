Magic_Mystery

Honestly this question was difficult i asked someone and they told me that to use hexcurse. i had no clue so i watched youtube and understood a little . basically then i searched the file header of .png format and then used hexcurse to alter the first line of 00 00 00 to the same header as png and corrected it . then downloaded it and then saw it and the flag was mentioned there .
